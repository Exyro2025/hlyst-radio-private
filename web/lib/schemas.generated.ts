// Shared show schema — the single source of truth for a show's shape, executed
// on BOTH sides. The controller runs it in settings.validate.validateShowsStrict
// (the update() chokepoint), in settings.normalize.normalizeShows (the lenient
// load path) and in the POST /shows route middleware; the browser runs the
// mirrored copy (web/lib/schemas.generated.ts).
//
// HARD RULE: this file may import ONLY from 'zod'. It is copied verbatim into
// the web bundle, so a project import or a node builtin here breaks the mirror.
// That includes OTHER schema modules — the mirror is one flat concatenation, so
// gen-schemas.ts rejects every specifier but 'zod' and each module has to stand
// alone. SHOW_ID_RE is therefore declared here and re-exported by
// settings/vocab.ts as ID_RE rather than living in a shared module.
//
// WHY A FACTORY. Unlike webhooks and stations, a show cannot be validated
// against itself: `personaId` has to name a real persona, `moods` a live mood,
// `themeId` an installed theme, and `maxTrackSeconds` clears a floor derived
// from the station's crossfade. Those four travel as ONE ShowSchemaContext
// value rather than as separate arguments — the shape the old four-parameter
// validateShowsStrict(raw, personas, allowedThemeIds, moodNames) grew into, and
// the same "one scope value, never unpacked" rule PickerScope follows. Both
// sides can build it: the admin panel already fetches personas, moods, themes
// and the station settings.
//
// Rules that are NOT pure functions of the submitted value — id minting and
// cross-row de-duplication — live in show-server.ts, which is NOT mirrored.

// Entity id: shows, personas and skills all share this pattern. Homed here
// because show is the first of the three to convert and a mirrored module
// cannot import a shared one (see the header). settings/vocab.ts re-exports it
// as ID_RE; whoever converts personas should decide its permanent home.

 *
 *   - `moodNames: null` — load runs before the mood cache is built, and moods
 *     are operator-editable, so filtering against the seed defaults there would
 *     strip an operator's own moods. A stale mood just matches nothing on air.
 *   - `themeIds: null` — load has no theme registry to consult. A stale id is
 *     harmless: GET /themes falls back to the station default at serve time.
 *   - `minTrackSeconds: null` — the crossfade-derived floor. Load clamps to the
 *     hard bounds instead of enforcing it.
 *
 * `personaIds` is NOT nullable: a show whose host does not exist has no owner
 * on either path. Strict throws, lenient drops the row — same rule, different
